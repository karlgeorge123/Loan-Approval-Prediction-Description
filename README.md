I worked on a Loan Approval Prediction project using Python and machine learning. Using a Kaggle dataset, I built a model to predict whether a loan application would be approved. 
I handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and trained a binary classification model while addressing the challenges of imbalanced data. I evaluated the model using 
precision, recall, and F1-score, and applied techniques like SMOTE to improve class balance. I also experimented with logistic regression for comparison. 
The tools I used were Pandas and Scikit-learn.
